**Changes made => using Next JS and typescript**

important notes about typescript for my future reference. 

Generics i.e. 

type StringArray = Array<string>;
  
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
  
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;

**you can also add a type check to the contents of the arry as shown above**

**Another important note, you can dynamically set the "type" later on by assign "Type", then later on declaring its type**
