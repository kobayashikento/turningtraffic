**Important notes about typescript for my future reference. **
1. **Generics i.e. **

type StringArray = Array<string>;
  
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
  
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>; <br>
**you can also add a type check to the contents of the arry as shown above**
<br><br>

2. **Another important note, you can dynamically set the "type" later on by assign "Type", then later on declaring its type**
